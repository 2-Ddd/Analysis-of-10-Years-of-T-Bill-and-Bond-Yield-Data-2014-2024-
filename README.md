For this assignment, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of bond yields from 2014 to 2024 consisting of descriptive statistical analysis, yield spread, scatter plots, moving averages, a correlation matrix, seasonal decomposition, rolling volatility, rolling correlation, and principal component analysis (PCA). With these in-depth analyses, a clearer understanding of bond yield dynamics was achieved, highlighting key trends, relationships, and volatility patterns that provide valuable insights into market behavior and potential economic conditions moving forward. In addition, I have also implemented all analyses from fundamental to advanced in a condensed Jupyter Notebook for a concise way to observe all visualizations.

Thank you!

Files Description:
1. A Comprehensive Report that documents my process, technical approach, findings, and insights regarding the data and visualizations.
2. An Excel file that performs data cleaning, data extraction through APIs, and fundamental analysis, along with basic visualizations.
3. A PowerBI file that contains both fundamental & advanced analysis along with advanced interactive visualizations and dashboards.
4. A PDF document that includes a detailed overview of the Power BI dashboard.  
5. An JupyterNotebook with additional advanced analysis and visualizations all fully implemented using only Python. This file also contains all previous analysis done in both Excel and PowerBI, please expand all fields to view these.
